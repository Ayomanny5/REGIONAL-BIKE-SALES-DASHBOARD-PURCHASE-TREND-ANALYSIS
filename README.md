# 🚴 Bike Sales Dashboard & Customer Purchase Analysis (Excel)

# 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes customer bike purchase behavior using Excel-based data analysis and dashboarding techniques. The goal is to identify key factors influencing purchase decisions and translate them into actionable business insights.

An interactive Excel dashboard was developed to track KPIs, compare customer segments, and support strategic decision-making around marketing, targeting, and regional growth.

# 🎯 Objectives

Analyze customer demographics and behavioral factors influencing bike purchases

Identify high-converting customer segments across regions, age groups, income, commute distance, and car ownership

Build a clean, interactive Excel dashboard suitable for executive-level reporting

Derive data-driven business recommendations

# 📊 Dataset Summary

The dataset contains 1,000 customer records with the following attributes:

Region

Age Group

Income Level

Cars Owned

Commute Distance

Purchase Flag (Yes / No)

The purchase flag was used to calculate conversion rates across all segments.

# 📈 Key KPIs Tracked

Total Customers

Total Buyers

Overall Purchase Rate

Top Converting Region

Top Converting Age Group

All KPIs update dynamically through pivot tables and formulas.

# 🔍 Key Insights

Optimal commute distance: Customers commuting 2–5 miles show the highest purchase rate (59%), indicating a practical cycling sweet spot.

Car ownership effect: Customers with 0 cars convert highest (61%), suggesting bikes act as a mobility substitute rather than a luxury item.

Age behavior: Nationally, the 30–40 age group leads purchases (59%), while adoption declines significantly after 60+.

Regional variation: The Pacific region outperforms all others (59%), with a unique pattern where under-30 customers dominate purchases (89%), unlike the national trend.

# 🧠 Business Interpretation

Bike purchases are primarily driven by mobility practicality, not income alone.

Urban professionals with low car ownership and moderate commute distances represent the highest-probability buyers.

Regional behavior differs significantly, requiring localized marketing strategies rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

# 📌 Strategic Business Recommendation

Adopt a segmented growth strategy focused on urban commuters. Nationally, prioritize 30–40 year-olds with low car ownership commuting 2–5 miles, positioning bikes as efficient everyday transport. In the Pacific region, aggressively scale youth-focused, lifestyle-driven marketing to capitalize on exceptionally high under-30 adoption. Align inventory, promotions, and messaging by region to maximize conversion efficiency and accelerate revenue growth.
